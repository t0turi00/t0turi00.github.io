# A Game Made With Unreal Engine 5


 **I Reused The Game Idea From The Polar Collaboration Project With German Students**

I made the game using UE5's Blueprint System. It uses the quite popular game format, where a character runs endlessly until they hit an object. <br />
All objects, animations and characters have been created by me. I used Blender to model, retopology, rig, animate and texture. ZBrush was used to sculpt my main character for the game.
